Usage: $script_name [OPTION]... [STOW_OPTION]...

Stow all packages in all stow directories, either in the current directory or in
COLLECTION.

Options:
  -c COLLECTION  run stow in the child directories of COLLECTION
  -f             do not check for .stow files in stow dirs
  -q             quiet mode
  -V             display version and exit
  -h             display this help and exit

Using the terminology of stow, a \"stows collection\" is a directory that
contains one or more \"stow directories,\" which themselves contain one or more
\"package directories.\" Stow is used to install symlinks pointing to the
contents of package directories in a \"target directory,\" such as \$HOME.

All command line parameters that do not match any of the above options are
passed to stow itself so that the target and other options can be set; for
example, \`stows -t \$HOME --restow -c \$HOME/stow\` (see the stow manpage).

Each internal call to stow is made with the working directory set to the one of
the stow directories, so the \"--dir\" stow option should not be specified.

Since stow directories in a collection will frequently be installed to the
same target, stows checks that a .stow file exists in each stow directory unless
the '-f' option is used. The existence of these files helps stow properly merge
symlinks from multiple stow directories.

Frequent options like \"--target=../../\" and \"--restow\" can be put in a
.stowrc file placed in each stow directory. In this case just running \`stows -c
\$HOME/stow\` is sufficient. You most likely want to specify at least the target
directory in .stowrc files; it simplifies the arguments passed to stows and
facilitates stowing multiple stow directories in different targets directories
by running one command. (See \"Resource Files\" in \`info stow\` for .stowrc
documentation.)

If the target directory is not given on the command line or in a .stowrc file,
stow will use the stows collection directory as the target (since it is the
parent directory of each stow directory); this is almost definitely not what you
want.\n"
